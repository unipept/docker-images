# Name: unipept-database
#
# This Dockerfile can be used to build an image that contains everything required to spin up a container with a
# functioning Unipept database (the database will be filled with all of the required data).
#
# Parameters (are being referenced as environment variables in the Dockerfile)
#   * DB_TYPES: names of the database sources that are to be parsed by this script (comma-delimited, one name per
#   source).
#   * DB_SOURCES: list of URLs that point to the database sources that should be used as a basis to construct the
#   database.
#   * FILTER_TAXA: a list of NCBI taxon ID's (comma-delimited) by which the resulting Unipept database should be
#   filtered. Only UniProt-entries that are associated with these ID's (or their children in the NCBI taxonomy
#   tree) are being kept during the build process.
#   * VERBOSE: Should all debugging information be printed during the Docker build? Is false by default.
#
# Mount-points:
#   * /index: Directory that will hold the Unipept database index. If this index is present from previous database
#   builds, and it is valid, it can help to speed up the construction process of future containers.
#   * /tmp: Directory that will be used by this container to store temporary files. Note that this directory can
#   become very large and that it will benefit from very fast storage.
#   * /tables: Directory that contains the generated database table files (that are used to fill up the constructed
#   database). These files will typically only be available during the construction process of the container.
#   * /var/lib/mysql: Directory that will contain the persistent MySQL datafiles. This directory should always be
#   mounted at the same location in order to start the database.
